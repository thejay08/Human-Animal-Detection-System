# 🧠 Human and Animal Detection System 🚨

A Streamlit-based AI application that detects and differentiates between humans and animals in images or video feeds, and classifies animals into specific categories using OpenAI’s CLIP model.

> ⚠️ **No pre-trained detection models like YOLO/COCO are used**, complying with strict model restrictions. Instead, this project leverages CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) from OpenAI.
